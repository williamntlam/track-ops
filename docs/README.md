# TrackOps Project Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the TrackOps project, organized by component and purpose.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Structure

### **Server Documentation** (`server/`)
Complete documentation for the TrackOps server application:
- **`README.md`** - API overview and quick start guide
- **`API-REFERENCE.md`** - Complete API endpoint documentation
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** - System architecture and design patterns
- **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Deployment guides for all environments
- **`DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md`** - Developer workflow and best practices
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Version history and release notes

### **Learning Documentation** (Learning-focused guides)
- **`architecture/`** - System design decisions and **why** we chose them
- **`standards/`** - Coding practices with explanations of **why** they matter
- **`patterns/`** - Design patterns with **when** and **why** to use them
- **`api/`** - API design principles and **why** we structure them this way
- **`learning/`** - Implementation guides and learning resources

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Philosophy

### **Learn by Doing**
- Implement code yourself with guidance
- Understand the reasoning behind each decision
- Build confidence through hands-on experience
- Ask "why" questions to deepen understanding

### **Understanding Over Memorization**
- Focus on concepts and principles
- Learn patterns that apply beyond this project
- Understand trade-offs and alternatives
- Build mental models for problem-solving

## How to Use This Documentation

### 1. **Before Implementing**
- Read the relevant architecture/pattern documentation
- Understand the **why** behind the approach
- Ask yourself: "What problem does this solve?"

### 2. **During Implementation**
- Use the standards as a guide, not a rigid rule
- Experiment and learn from mistakes
- Ask questions when something doesn't make sense

### 3. **After Implementation**
- Reflect on what you learned
- Consider alternative approaches
- Think about how to apply this knowledge elsewhere

## Learning Goals

By the end of this project, you should understand:
- **Why** we use hexagonal architecture
- **How** to design clean, testable code
- **When** to apply different design patterns
- **What** makes good API design
- **How** to handle errors gracefully
